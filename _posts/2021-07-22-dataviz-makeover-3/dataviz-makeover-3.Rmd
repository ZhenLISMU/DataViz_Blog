# 1. Original Visualization

![](pic/ori1.jpg)

![](pic/ori2.jpg)
The orignal visualization reflect the death cases and positive cases situation in Jakarta. The data source is from [Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/).For creating the data visualisation above, the file dated on **30 Juni 2021 Pukul 10.00** is used. The purpose of visualization is to prepare two data visualization to support the news write-up of the latest development in DKI Jakarta.

# 2. Critiques & Suggestions

## 2.1 Clarity 

![](pic/ori3.jpg)

- ***Improper annotation for top 5 districts: *** The annotations of top 5 districts are the district names which can't reflect the number of deaths and the annotations overlap the point of **CENGKENG**. Therefore, the annotation didn't help highlight top 5 districts and even make the visualization effect worse. The information readers can get from annotation is the name of top 5 highest districts which can be found easily on the Y-axis.

- ***Improper X-axis title: *** The x-axis title of second visualization is misleading. It will make readers interpret wrongly about the level of cumulative positive cases data. It should also mentioned the data was grouped by city and should also show the variation of average cumulative data. 

## 2.2 Aethetics

- ***Improper Chart Type of Cumulative Deaths: *** Since the data is cumulative deaths, scatter plot can't help readers understand the deaths and hard to figure out the accurate number of deaths of different districts. Moreover, the scatter plot is also difficult for readers to find the point corresponding to each district. The scatter plot can't help readers to find insightful ideas about death cases.
