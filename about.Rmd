  Welcome to my blog!

These blog posts record my projects and assignments of Visualization Analytics and Application course during the learning journey of [Master of IT in Business (MITB)](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/master-it-business) in [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). 

I mainly used the R and Tableau to build this website and finish the assignments. 

Hope you can enjoying them!
